**Gulp auto compiling separate js/css**

> npm i  
gulp watch

**After the "gulp watch", work in the "sass" and/or "js" folder.**  
Gulp takes care of compiling into .css and .js files properly.  

### Explanation of compiled files
#### JS 
> `global.js` (use everywhere)  
> `main.js` (use on the \*.ecosia.* pages)  
> `newtab.js` (use in the new tab page)  
> `popup.js` (use in the popup)  
> `vendors.js` (use everywhere) < Contains used js libraries such as jquery  
> `ecosia/main.js` (use in the new tab page) < native ecosia script  

   
#### CSS 
> `main.css` (use for overwrite page css)  
> `newtab.css` (css of the new tab page)  
> `popup.css` (css of the popup)
> `ecosia/main.css` (use in the new tab page) < native ecosia style

**NOTE** : Both .css include "global" folder with globals scss vars/mixins/helpers

For the HTML of the popup, it's simply in ecosia-dark-mode.html
