**Gulp auto compiling separate js/css**

> npm i  
gulp watch

**After the "gulp watch", work in the "sass" and/or "js" folder.**  
Gulp takes care of compiling into .css and .js files properly.  

### Explanation of compiled files
#### JS 
> vendors.js (use everywhere) < Contains used js libraries such as jquery  
> main.js (use on the page)  
> popup.js (use in the popup)  

   
#### CSS 
> main.css (use for overwrite page css)  
> popup.css (css of the popup)  

**NOTE** : Both .css include "global" folder with globals scss vars/mixins/helpers

For the HTML of the popup, it's simply in ecosia-dark-mode.html
